# Mile$

A logging app for drivers

One of our team used to be a delivery driver, and one of the biggest challenges he came across was finding a good free and intuitive mileage tracking app. This project is designed to solve that problem. **Mile$** is a simple and easy to use application that will help you log your miles and earnings and do some math to help you figure out how much you're making an hour.
